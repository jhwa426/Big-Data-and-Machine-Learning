        "# The Central Limit Theorem\n",
        "\n",
        "The central limit theorem (CLT) theorem is very useful in probability theory. The idea is that if you take a reasonably large sample from **any** distribution, you know that that random sample's mean is normally distributed. Let me clarify.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you:\n",
        "\n",
        "-\tTake a random sample of at least 30 elements from a population of **any** distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "-\tThen find the mean of that sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you drew thousands of samples, then you would find that the distribution of all of those averages forms a normal (bell-shaped) distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cool! So what's the CLT good for?\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, because of the CLT, we know that samples of the mean will be normally distributed regardless of what shape the underlying distribution is. We can use this information to create confidence intervals (i.e., construct a range of values where the population’s mean is likely to lie.) We can also do something called z-tests, where we estimate if a given value is likely to have come from the population-based on what we know about the sample. \n",
